cappanera's suggestion:
1.) comment one of the terms (vol,bd,interior) and see if frobenius norm changes
even with the matrix being reassembled.


current ideas:
1.) comment out 



goal: 
1.) I think the goal as of right now is that even when we reassemble the matrix
at every time step that our frobenius norm isn't changing.
